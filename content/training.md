# NHibernate training course

As a former member of the NHibernate development team and a long time user of NHibernate in real-world projects, I wanted to offer a course that teaches people how NHibernate really works and how they can get the best possible results from using it.

## On-site or off-site

Sending multiple employees to a commercial training quickly gets expensive. If you have the accommodations for it, it's typically much cheaper to conduct training on-site. Then again, if you can't organize it on-site, off-site training is your only alternative. I'm available to do on-site training throughout the year. I'll also organize at least one public training in 2012, though I haven't set a date yet. I can also organize a private off-site training for you, provided that at least 5 people attend the training. If you're interested, [contact me](#contact_section) for details.
