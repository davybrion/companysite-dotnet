# Medium to long-term contracting
I've been in professional software development for 9 years, 7 of which I've spent contracting for 3 clients. I've spent over 5 years with one client, 6 months with the second client, and now over a year with my current client. Which means I'm **currently not available** for this kind of work.

I worked as a developer for the first years of my career, and after that I've mostly been in an architect/coach role, but I'd be happy to join a strong team as a senior developer or dev lead as well. Whatever my role would be, it would have to be a very hands-on technical position.

When available, I'm interested in challenging and interesting projects or positions that span 6 months or more. I primarily work with the .NET platform, but I'm also continuously gaining experience with Node.js and Ruby and would be interested in projects using those technologies as well. My CV is available upon request.
