# Medium to long-term contracting
I've been in professional software development for 10 years, 8 of which I've spent contracting for 4 clients. Durations per client have varied from over 5 years to 6 months. I'm **currently not available** for this kind of work.

I worked as a developer for the first years of my career, and after that I've mostly been in an architect/coach role, but I'd be happy to join a strong team as a senior developer or dev lead as well. Whatever my role would be, it would have to be a very hands-on technical position.

When available, I'm interested in challenging and interesting projects. I primarily work with the .NET platform, but I'm also continuously gaining experience with Node.js and Ruby and would be interested in projects using those technologies as well. My CV is available upon request.
