<p>I just released Agatha 1.0 which you can download <a href="http://code.google.com/p/agatha-rrsl/downloads/list" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; The biggest changes since the 1.0 beta 2 release is the support for the <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/2009/12/one-way-or-fire-and-forget-requests-with-agatha/" target="_blank">one-way requests</a> and the ability to easily run the service layer <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/2009/12/running-an-agatha-service-layer-in-process-without-wcf/" target="_blank">within the same process as your client</a> (if you donâ€™t need or want WCF for example).</p>  <p>As for the next version (1.1) the biggest focus will be on the caching layer, and the ability to pick your own error handling strategy.</p>  <p>I hope the few users that we have will enjoy this :)</p>
