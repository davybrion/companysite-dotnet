I just got the following <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/07/the-mvvm-pattern-is-highly-overrated/#comment-50017">comment</a> on my post about MVVM being overrated:

<blockquote>
Sorry, but you’re just talking.

Where’s the code ?

I mean you seem to have all the time in the world to just say things on your blog , but no time to put together a simple sample up.

I seriously doubt you understand what you talk about.

As you can probably tell from my <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/07/the-mvvm-pattern-is-highly-overrated/#comment-50019">reaction</a>, i got pretty pissed off.  Normally, i don't let comments like that get to me.  But in this case, i have been spending quite a bit of my personal time working on a sample and preparing the blog posts.  I'm actually planning to spend quite a bit of my weekend on this (as i did last weekend), not to mention that i'm also gonna spend a couple of hours working on it during my day off tomorrow.

I'm not getting paid for any of this.  In fact, i'm only getting shit for doing this.  The handful of people who are looking at this because they're tired of the MSDN-way of developing things will appreciate it, but the vast majority of people who're gonna read it are going to complain because "it's too complicated!" or "i have to think too much!".  Well, you know what?  You're not the kind of developer i'm targeting anyway.  If you stumble upon a post of mine about Silverlight or anything else that's hot in MSDN-land, you probably got here through a link-blog or a link on twitter.  And in those cases, odds are pretty high that the way i think about software development and the way you think about it don't exactly match.  And that's ok.  I'll do what i wanna do in the way i feel it's right to do so, and i suggest you do the same.  But pressuring me into backing up the stuff i say with code is not really gonna get you anything sooner.  I'm still gonna do whatever it is that i'm gonna do in a time frame that suits <em>me, not you</em>.

And to top it all off, i just got the following reply from the same guy:

"I’ll just say this.

When you make a public statement , you better have some code ready to prove it."

Priceless, ain't it?
