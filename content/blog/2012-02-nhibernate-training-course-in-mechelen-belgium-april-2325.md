I'm organizing a public NHibernate Training Course from April 23rd through April 25th in Mechelen, Belgium. This time, I'm taking care of the whole thing myself instead of working together with a more established training company (except for renting a suitable training location). This enables me to offer the course at a lower price than the previous public course. All details can be found <a href="http://thatextramile.be/training/nhibernate">here</a>. Feel free to spread the word! :)
