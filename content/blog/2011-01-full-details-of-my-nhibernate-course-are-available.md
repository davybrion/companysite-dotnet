I've teamed up with <a href="http://www.sparkles.be">Sparkles</a> to organize an NHibernate course. It'll be an intensive 3-day course, from April 4th to the 6th. The location still needs to be decided but it will be in Belgium.  Full details are available <a href="http://www.sparkles.be/training/nhibernatemasterclass2011.aspx">here</a>.  All attendees will also receive a copy of the <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/nhibernate-3-0-cookbook/book">NHibernate 3.0 Cookbook</a>.  Hope to see some of you there :)
