<p>I’m not the best debugger out there, but i usually manage to get to the bottom of things and sometimes i even enjoy chasing down a weird bug.&#160; And while i actively try to avoid bugs as much as possible, i’m also always looking to learn more techniques or practices to efficiently find and fix bugs when they do occur.&#160; So when i first heard about Paul Butcher’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debug-Repair-Prevent-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193435628X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264250644&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Debug It</a>, i immediately preordered it.&#160; And now that i’ve read it, i’m very glad i did.</p>  <p>The book is divided in 3 parts.&#160; The chapters of the first part explain in depth what kind of debugging strategy you’ll need.&#160; Discussed topics include:</p>  <ul>   <li>figuring out what you’re really looking for </li>    <li>tips and tricks to come up with a reliable reproduction of the bug and the value of having that reproduction </li>    <li>diagnosing the <em>actual</em> problem </li>    <li>coming up with a <em>true</em> fix </li>    <li>reflecting on why the bug ever got into the software</li>    <li>making sure that the bug can’t come back and that we learn from the mistake</li> </ul>  <p>For some of you, most of this stuff will just be common sense.&#160; For a lot of developers though, this part alone should be considered required reading.&#160; It’s a complete process of how to deal with bugs efficiently in less than 80 pages!&#160; Think about that for a second: 80 pages that <em>will</em> improve your efficiency at your job and will reduce the amount of time you spend doing something you probably don’t like doing.&#160; How could you resist?</p>  <p>The second part is pretty short (only 2 chapters) but pretty interesting as well.&#160; It mostly deals with organizational patterns and practices that a development shop should take into account.&#160; It covers things such as:</p>  <ul>   <li>     <div align="left">the importance of bug tracking</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">what makes a good bug report</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">effective communication with users and support staff</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">giving priority to bugs as soon as they’re discovered</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">the importance of pragmatic zero-tolerance for bugs</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">ways to get out of a Quality Hole</div>   </li> </ul>  <p align="left">Not all developers will like the second part, but it definitely contains some valuable information for technical managers, or for developers who need to convince their technical managers ;)</p>  <p align="left">The third part of the book deals with a lot of various strategies for a variety of specific situations.&#160; While not everyone will get something out of every topic discussed in this part, odds are that quite a few of them will indeed be interesting for you.&#160; You’ll find specific advice for quite a few special cases (performance, concurrency, backwards compatibility, third-party bugs, etc…).&#160; You’ll also find the obligatory chapter on creating an ideal debugging environment with automated tests, a build system and continuous integration.&#160; If you’re reading this blog, you’re hopefully already convinced of the values of such things so you might want to skip this chapter.&#160; The final 2 chapters are again very interesting… They’ll show you how you can write software that will debug itself.&#160; While not everyone will actually go out and do this, some ideas of that chapter should definitely be kept in mind by most of us.&#160; The final chapter deals with some common (mostly organizational) anti-patterns for dealing with bugs.</p>  <p align="left">All in all, there is just a lot of tremendously valuable information in this book.&#160; And it’s only about 190 pages so it definitely won’t take you a long time to read it.&#160; I’ve frequently been amazed at the inability of developers to efficiently debug issues when they occur.&#160; And i’m not just talking about bad developers.&#160; I’ve seen plenty of good or even great developers having trouble with debugging efficiently.&#160; This book would definitely get them on the right track, with just a little bit effort.</p>
