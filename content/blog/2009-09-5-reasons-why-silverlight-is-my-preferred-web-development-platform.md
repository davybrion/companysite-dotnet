If you landed on this post while doing research as to whether or not Silverlight is a technology worth learning or using, please read the following posts as well, which i wrote about a year after writing the one below: [Keep Your Eyes On The Road](http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/09/keep-your-eyes-on-the-road/) and [Learn To Work With The Web Instead Of Against It](http://davybrion.com/blog/2011/01/learn-to-work-with-the-web-instead-of-against-it/). Simply put, Silverlight is no longer my preferred web development platform for a variety of reasons i mention in those two posts.
