Just finished reading James Shore &amp; Shane Warden's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1210266909&amp;sr=8-1">The Art Of Agile Development</a>. The title says it's about agile development, but this book is very specifically about Extreme Programming, other agile methodologies aren't covered. A lot of the content of this book applies to other agile methodologies as well though.  This book does an amazing job of not only showing you what agile development ideally looks like, but also gives a lot of tips and helpful information on how to get to that point. After a thorough introduction on agile development and XP, the book covers a large list of XP values, principles and practices, grouped together in different categories: Thinking, Collaborating, Releasing, Planning and Developing. Each practice is covered very thoroughly and clearly. Finally, the book closes with a few more chapters on how to master your agility as a team after you've gotten used to the values, principles and practices covered earlier.  This is one of the best books on software development you'll ever read.
