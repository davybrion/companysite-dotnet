<p>Please, pretty please, make the Tuple class serializable… i just got this exception:</p>  <p>Type 'System.Tuple`2[System.Guid,System.Nullable`1[System.Guid]]' cannot be serialized. Consider marking it with the DataContractAttribute attribute, and marking all of its members you want serialized with the DataMemberAttribute attribute. Alternatively, you can ensure that the type is public <strong>and has a parameterless constructor</strong> - all public members of the type will then be serialized, and no attributes will be required.</p>  <p>That’s all… now if you’ll excuse me, i gotta go include a useless DTO in my project.</p>
