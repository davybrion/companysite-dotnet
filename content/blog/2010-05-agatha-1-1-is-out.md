<p>I just released the 1.1 version of Agatha.&#160; It’s a bit sooner than i had originally expected it to be, but the reason why i’m releasing the current trunk is because i want to move the current trunk to .NET 4 and Silverlight 4.&#160; So, the 1.1 version is still targeting .NET 3.5 and Silverlight 3 but apart from possible bugfix releases (1.1.x), there will be no more version targeting .NET 3.5 and Silverlight 3.</p>  <p>These are the changes between the 1.0.1 and the 1.1 release:</p>  <ul>   <li>Support for the NInject container (patch contributed by Ian Davis). </li>    <li>First version of the <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/2009/12/agathas-caching-layer-implementation-first-draft/" target="_blank">server side caching layer</a>.&#160; Consider this implementation to be experimental and there are most likely plenty of issues with it.&#160; Issues that pop up will obviously be fixed in further 1.1.x releases and the trunk as well.&#160; </li>    <li>AsyncRequestDispatcher and RequestDispatcher now have a virtual AfterSendingRequests virtual method where you can add some custom code if you need to. </li>    <li>Both Request/Response types and RequestHandler can now be located in multiple assemblies (patch contributed by Jason Diamond) </li>    <li>Castle Windsor binaries have been updated to version 2.1 </li>    <li>Castle support for Silverlight has been added </li>    <li>The Process method of the IWcfRequestProcessor service contract now allows transaction flowing </li>    <li>All configuration classes have been made a bit more fluently (thanks to Mark Meyers) </li>    <li>There is now an Agatha.Servicelayer.Silverlight assembly which contains a lightweight version of the service layer to run within your Silverlight application if you want/need this </li>    <li>Support for the StructureMap container (patch contributed by Andrew Rea) </li>    <li>The IWcfRequestProcessor service contract now <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/andrewrea/archive/2010/03/09/compiling-examples-for-consuming-the-rest-endpoints-for-wcf-service-using-agatha.aspx" target="_blank">supports REST (JSON + XML)</a> (patch contributed by Andrew Rea) </li>    <li>RequestDispatcher contains a BeforeReturningResponses method where you can put some additional code to modify responses before they are returned to the consumer of the dispatcher. </li>    <li>The serverside RequestProcessor contains a few extra virtual methods which enables you to customize how exceptions are logged (patch contributed by Emil Ingerslev) </li>    <li>Fixed NullReferenceException in MessageInspector when using one-way requests in combination with INFO logging </li> </ul>  <p>So basically, everyone that’s been running on the trunk is probably better off using the 1.1 version, unless you’re willing to move to .NET 4.</p>  <p>You can download the 1.1 version <a href="http://code.google.com/p/agatha-rrsl/downloads/list" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  <p>The goals for the 1.2 release are to take as much advantage as possible from new .NET 4 and WCF 4 improvements, and also to make the caching layer as good as it can be.&#160; And yes, that will include some form of client-side caching :)</p>
