<p>One of several interesting things in Mark Meyers’ <a href="http://code.google.com/p/quicknet/" target="_blank">QuickNet</a> project is the whole input generation thing that you need for property-based testing.&#160; It turns out that those input generators are very usable for far more purposes than just property-based testing, so it’s evolved into its own library.&#160; It can generate object instances of almost any kind, while you can still have fine-grained control over the generation if you want to.&#160; You can use it for simple types, complex objects or even entire object graphs. I wish i had time to write a more in-depth post about this, but for now i’m just gonna point you guys in the right direction, and i hope that you’ll see the value in this :)</p>  <p>The announcement of the first release can be found <a href="http://kilfour.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/quickgenerate-0-1-released/" target="_blank">here</a>, and an example can be found <a href="http://kilfour.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/quickgenerate-example/" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; Here’s a little glimpse at the code of one the examples:</p>  <p><a href="http://davybrion.com/pictures/CheckOutQuickGenerate_7FE6/quickgenerate.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="quickgenerate" border="0" alt="quickgenerate" src="http://davybrion.com/pictures/CheckOutQuickGenerate_7FE6/quickgenerate_thumb.png" width="653" height="500" /></a> </p>  <p>I think that piece of code is a nice illustration of how powerful and flexible this is :)</p>
