A former coworker of mine posted an <a href="http://kilfour.wordpress.com/2009/08/02/testing-tool-tour-quicknet-preview/">interesting preview to his new testing framework</a>, called QuickNet.  The example he used is pretty simple (a calculator), but the results are pretty interesting so be sure to check this out.

I'm hoping he'll post some real world examples (or at least based a bit more on real word code) of QuickNet soon, and maybe even a brief comparison between QuickNet and something like Pex? :)
