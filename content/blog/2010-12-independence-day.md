I'm one of those rare people who's spent more than a few years with his first employer.  In fact, i've been there for 8 years and 2 months now.  I spent the first 5 years and 3 months working for a client of ours, and then another 6 months working for another client.  After that, i moved to our own office where i worked on some projects at first, and then mostly on our products.  I've learned a lot of great stuff during those 8 years, and i've grown a lot as a person as well.  But the time has come for some serious changes. 

I recently started my own company, called That Extra Mile (no website yet).  As of January 3rd, i'm going to be working at a client that i'm very excited about.  I also plan on doing some other stuff such as (very) short-term consulting, occasionally some workshops/training and i also want to get into iPhone/iPad (and perhaps Android) development.  If you were wondering why it's been so quiet on this blog the past few weeks, now you know why.  But now that everything has been taken care of and has been set up properly, things can finally get back to how they used to be around here :)
