I saw 2 blog posts today from tech bloggers who were talking about their new-year resolutions.  Both of them said that they wanted to increase the number of posts they'll write next year.  Both of them had over 50 posts this year.  There's nothing bad (on the contrary) about writing 50 posts in a year.  Hell, that's actually a great pace because it's reasonably sustainable and it leaves you with enough time to focus on a variety of things.

I've been blogging for 3,5 years and I have 565 posts so far.  That's an average of 161 a year, or almost 13,5 a month or a little over 3 a week.  That's insane.  And it really isn't sustainable because you will run out of material before you know it and if you're not careful, you'll be tempted to stick to your posting schedule just to keep the visitor stats up. And let's be honest here: we <em>all</em> care about those stats just a little bit too much... don't trust the bloggers who say they don't ;).  And once you get into that habit of wanting to write posts just because you feel like you <em>have</em> to, it's time to take a small step back.  You're blogging, which is great, but it really isn't all that important.  It's not worth putting in the time and effort unless you really feel like doing it. 

So to summarize my advice: blog when you want to, when you feel like you've got something interesting to share.  Don't blog when you don't really feel like it and don't blog because you think you have to.  Make sure you have enough spare time to spend on things outside of blogging and technology in general. 

As for me, I'm aiming for 50 posts next year instead of the usual 161 and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. At all :)
