Just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Release-Production-Ready-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1211111376&sr=8-1">Release It!</a> The subtitle of the book is: Design and deploy production-ready software. And this book really offers a lot of great advice on how to do exactly that. In the first two parts, patterns (and anti-patterns) are provided to show you how you can ensure stability and capacity in your systems.  These two parts alone are already tremendously valuable, but there is a lot more goodness in this book. The book also gives excellent advice on how to configure your network of servers, security and passwords, load balancing and clustering, dealing with configuration files, making your system transparent for Operations and making your software adaptable to future changes. The author uses excellent real-word examples throughout the book to stress the importance of the advice he offers. When you skim over the table of contents before reading it, you might think not every part of this book will interest you as much as the others, but the author's writing style really does keep everything at least interesting, and in most cases, even fascinating.  And often, quite funny as well.
