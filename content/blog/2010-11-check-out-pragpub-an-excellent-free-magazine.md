In case you've missed it, as i have for the first 15 issues, the Pragmatic Programmers have an excellent free magazine called <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/magazines">PragPub</a>.  There's a new issue every month which you can either read online, or download in a couple of formats (pdf, epub, mobi) so you can read it on pretty much every device you want. It's about software development in general, with no particular focus on a certain technology.  Just great content with great variety. And it's free.  So do yourself a favor, and check it out if you haven't already :)
