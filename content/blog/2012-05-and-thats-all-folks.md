I started blogging about 5 years ago, and over the years I've published 653 posts. This will be the last one. I had some specific personal goals in mind when I started blogging, and I've gotten everything I've wanted out of it, and more. I learned a lot, and I'm happy with a lot of the feedback I've gotten over the years. But the time has come to move on. I want to get back to writing more code instead of writing about writing code. I've mostly enjoyed writing blog posts, but in the past year it has felt more like a chore than a hobby, so it's probably a good idea to just call it quits.

I'm not entirely sure yet what I'm going to do with the content on this blog. There's quite a few posts I surely want to keep around, but certainly not all of them. For now, I'm going to keep the blog up so everything stays available but after a while, I'm gonna shut it down. I might keep up some kind of static archive of my favorite posts, or I might just put them on GitHub in MarkDown format. If you have any suggestions on what I should do with it, I'd be happy to hear them.

I will remain active on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/davybrion) and I plan to be more active on [GitHub](http://github.com/davybrion) from now on. But the blogging thing ends here and now. I'd like to thank everyone for reading, especially the ones who've been around since the beginning. It's been an interesting ride for me, but it's time for something else :)
