<p>Ever had to work with a developer who continuously <strike>bitches</strike> whines about <em>everything</em>? It’s one of the worst possible things that can happen to a team of developers.&#160; I have one golden rule when it comes to bitching: if you are willing to put in the effort to improve the situation, then i don’t have a problem with it.&#160; In fact, i bitch a lot too but at least i try to improve whatever it is that i’m bitching about.&#160; If you’re merely bitching but not willing to put some effort into improving things, then you would really do everyone a favor by simply keeping your mouth shut.</p>  <p>Let’s examine for a second how a whiny developer can come across to his/her coworkers:</p>  <ul>   <li>you might be very lazy because you don’t want to solve problems you’re complaining about</li>    <li>you might be incapable of solving problems that you complain about</li>    <li>you might just be unwilling to actually solve problems</li>    <li>you might just expect other people to solve your problems all the time</li>    <li>you might just be completely out of touch with reality</li>    <li>you’re probably not a good teammate</li>    <li>you probably only care about what <em>you</em> need to do</li>    <li>you are definitely a huge pain in the ass</li> </ul>  <p>Either one of those isn’t very good, is it? Not to mention when people think more than one those things of you.</p>  <p>I think a team of developers is always better off without the whiny developer.&#160;&#160; It’s what professional sports coaches often call “Addition by subtraction”.&#160; Sometimes you have a talented team that isn’t going anywhere.&#160; They aren’t winning the games they should be capable of winning and the team gives the impression that they’ve simply stopped caring.&#160; In many cases, these teams suddenly start performing better once the rotten apple in the group has been traded or simply cut from the team.&#160; No matter how talented you might be, if you aren’t translating that talent into <em>actual value</em> and are just wearing down your team mates, then you don’t belong on the team.</p>  <p>If you’re a developer who complains a lot, please think about what your presence on a team really means.&#160; Are you really contributing anything positive?&#160; Could it be possible that the team is better off without you?&#160; Would you really not care if your team members would rather not work with you?&#160; Can you understand why your team members complain about <em>you</em>?</p>
