<p>Some people frequently ask me why i spend so much time working<em> for free </em>outside of my job.&#160; Other people frequently ask me why i don’t go to work for a bigger company because “they pay better”.&#160; The title of this post is the answer to both questions.&#160; I don’t really think money is all that important in my life right now.&#160; I’m not rich or anything, and i don’t make huge amounts of money.&#160; I do make enough to live comfortably, right now.&#160; As long as i can live comfortably, i don’t really feel the need or urge to make more money or to “better myself” as the recruiters like to call it.&#160; What is far more important to me is what i get to do, instead of how much i get for doing it.&#160; If i have the choice between a high paying job which would increase the number of unwanted situations i have to deal with, or a lower paying job which would enable me to work on interesting things, then i wouldn’t even consider it a choice right now.&#160; I’d go for the most interesting one without a doubt, provided of course, that i can resume living comfortably.</p>  <p>I often cringe when i see people leaving a good job (or turning it down) just because they can make a bit more somewhere else.&#160; They never seem to realize that more money often means a lot more crap you have to deal with or put up with.&#160; Want to work for a big company that offers big paychecks?&#160; Fine, go ahead, but don’t expect it to be a wonderful ride.&#160; There’s a reason why those companies have a lot of money, and it’s because <em>everything is about the money.</em>&#160; You hate the fact that you have to do something that you’re not comfortable with?&#160; Too bad, suck it up and do it because that’s how the company gets paid.&#160; Granted, <em>every</em> job has moments and situations like that but it’s all about how <em>frequently</em> they occur.&#160; And those kinds of situations and moments are just a natural side effect of working for a large company.&#160; In those places, people are typically there for the job security, the money or the status.&#160; It invariably leads to an environment where the actual quality of the work is never someone’s primary focus.&#160; Well, at least not somebody <em>important enough</em> to actually make a difference, that is.&#160; I’ve worked in an environment like that, and i would never want go back to something like that.&#160; I get miserable when i have to be in an environment like that for more than a short while, so what good will that extra money be for me then? Not a whole lot.</p>  <p>As for working for free outside of my job, it’s pretty much the same thing.&#160; I could start working on some commercial products which i could sell, but that isn’t always a lot of fun either.&#160; You’d have to spend a lot of time polishing things and that’s almost always boring, frustrating work.&#160; Not exactly what i’d want to do at night or during my weekends.&#160; You’d also have to deal with issues that customers of your software have, and that can be a very annoying and frustrating experience as well.&#160; But you’d have to do it and you’d have to do a good job of it no matter how little you feel like doing it at that time because hey, it’s a paying customer.&#160; It also increases your no-fun-workload because you have to deal with some legal issues when you’re releasing commercial software.&#160; Are you sure you can sell your software without getting raped by the financial authorities in the country you live in?&#160; Are you sure you can’t get sued for your software in some way?&#160; If you want to deal with all of that, go ahead.&#160; I won’t.</p>  <p>Instead, outside of work i prefer to work on whatever i want to work on, whenever i want to work.&#160; If i feel like writing some blog posts, i’ll write some blog posts.&#160; If i feel like writing some code, i’ll write some code.&#160; If i don’t feel like working, there is no pressure whatsoever for me to do anything.&#160; I’m pretty much fully in charge of what i do and when i do it.&#160; I get to learn from what i do, and i get to help other people who also want to learn.&#160; All of that is worth <em>a lot more</em> to me than making some extra money.</p>
