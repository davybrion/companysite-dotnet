I finally got around to putting my new <a href="http://thatextramile.be" target="_blank">company website</a> online. I originally planned to do this sometime last year, but it just kept getting postponed for a variety of reasons. I'm pretty bad at graphic/web design so I had the design done by <a href="http://frozenyogurt.be/" target="_blank">Ken Bekaert</a> since I thought he had already done a great job on my <a href="http://twitpic.com/5zgm99" target="_blank">logo and business cards</a>. Next up was the slicing of the design to HTML and CSS. I could theoretically do that myself, but it would've taken me way too long and I would not have enjoyed it one bit, so I preferred to have it done by some old <a href="http://nivario.be/" target="_blank">friends who know what they're doing</a>. After that, it was finally my turn to play around with it :)

So of course, I couldn't resist doing the site with Express/Node.js. And I'm pretty happy with the result too: about <a href="https://github.com/davybrion/companysite/tree/master/lib" target="_blank">130 lines of server-side code</a> that allows me to write the content of the site in Markdown (including caching and automatically updating the cache if the Markdown files are updated) and my <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/2011/12/displaying-feed-items-on-a-web-page-my-solution/" target="_blank">preferred solution to displaying feed items</a>. Does a simple site like this call for Express/Node.js? Of course not. But I knew it would be simple and fun, so that's why I used it.  

The hardest part was actually writing the content of the site. Apparently, writing content for a company website is a lot harder than churning out a few blog posts occasionally, and I definitely underestimated that. Not because there's a lot of content (there's very little actually), but because you want to <em>avoid</em> ending up with a lot of content. It has to be concise and yet still contain everything you want it to say. After many revisions, it says everything I want it to say, and unlike on this blog I actually managed to keep it short :)

An extra benefit of doing it with Express/Node.js is that it reminded me how much fun I have working with that stack, so I'm going to get back to work on my <a href="https://github.com/davybrion/therabbithole" target="_blank">breakable toy</a> which I've been neglecting for too long. I suppose this will lead to a few future posts as well :)
