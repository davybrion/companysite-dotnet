Sorry for the shameful promotion, but you would do it too ;). <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bartdeleye" target="_blank">Bart Deleye</a> was kind enough to write a review of my <a href="http://thatextramile.be/training/nhibernate">NHibernate course</a> which i'd like to share here:

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Davy's NHibernate course is an excellent cocktail based on ingredients like expertise, high quality content, hands-on labs and best practices.</p>

<p>Day 1 starts with an introduction on ORM's in general after which we take a deep dive in the different configuration options (both using HBM files and Fluent NHibernate) from which you’ll acquire a thorough understanding of the mapping capabilities and the different solutions NHibernate provides for the impedance mismatch. Afterwards the theory will be applied in practice during the hands-on labs that are test-driven by NUnit code samples. This style of exercises not only clearly illustrates the usage of NHibernate but also provides you a nice toolkit to experiment further after the course. We finished the day with best practices on transaction/session management in different environments (web applications, services and desktop applications).</p>

<p>During Day 2 you will grasp the fundamental details of all query methods available in NHibernate with their pro's and con's. The course is based on NH 3 by the way, so you will learn everything on HQL, Criteria, QueryOver and LINQ. During the hands-on labs you will implement some nice challenging queries. Afterwards you will learn a lot of best and worst practices regarding performance with optimizations like Futures (query batching), statement batching, executable HQL, fetching strategies, projecting, and leaning on the session cache. The second day is finished with a session on the different concurrency strategies.</p>

<p>Day 3 covers a lot of advanced techniques that make your NHibernate skill set complete like Identifier and Inheritance strategies, Advanced Mappings, Second Level Cache, Stateless Sessions, … To finish the course, you’ll have to fix some red tests during the exercises.</p>

<p>I can only recommend this course to every new, novice and experienced NHibernate user. Only a few weeks later I notice a lot of improvement amongst my team members!<p>

Bart and his team were the first people to attend the course almost 2 months ago, so i wasn't entirely sure yet of the format and the content at that time. This week i'm actually doing the course for the third time, and apart from some very minor changes and tweaks, it's pretty much the exact same as when i did it the first time, except that i'm not nearly as nervous now as i was when i did it the first time. Luckily for me, his team was fun to hang out with and there was plenty of joking around which definitely made it easy to just be comfortable instead of being a nervous wreck :)
