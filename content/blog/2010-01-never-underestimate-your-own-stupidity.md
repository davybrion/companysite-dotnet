<p>I was trying to deploy one of our applications on a customer’s environment.&#160; We have a database server on their network, and a web server.&#160; I installed the database, installed the web application and tried to run it.&#160; It didn’t.&#160; Our logfile showed this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>System.InvalidOperationException: Timeout expired.&#160; The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool.&#160; This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in use and max pool size was reached.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I figured i had made a mistake with the configuration of SQL Server, so i checked some settings and tried it again.&#160; Still didn’t work.&#160; Did this a couple of times but i couldn’t get it to connect to the database and i kept getting the same error.</p>  <p>Eventually i wrote a stupid winforms app with a button that would connect to a database based on a connection string in its app.config file.&#160; Copied it to the webserver, copied the connection string from the web application to the config file of the stupid winforms app and tried it.&#160; Still got the same exception.</p>  <p>I figured there might be a problem with connecting to the database from the web server, so i copied the stupid winforms app to the database server and tried it there.&#160; It still didn’t work, even though i could connect without problems using SQL Server Management Studio.</p>  <p>After a while i finally noticed that i had mistyped the name of the database server in the connection string, and once i typed the correct name, everything worked :)</p>  <p>Total time lost: about 90 minutes.</p>  <p>Required change: adding 1 extra character to the connection string.</p>  <p>Then again, i would’ve noticed this sooner if the exception message was a bit more clear about the actual problem (not finding the server) ;)</p>
