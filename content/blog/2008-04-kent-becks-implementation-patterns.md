A new book from Kent Beck about writing code? I just couldn't resist ordering it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Implementation-Patterns-Addison-Wesley-Signature-Kent/dp/0321413091/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1208765740&amp;sr=8-1">Implementation Patterns</a> is a (very short) book with the goal of helping you communicate your intentions as a developer through your code.  The patterns in this book are all very short, and usually are nothing more than simple descriptions of different implementation choices that you as a developer can make.

Don't think that these patterns are similar to design patterns or anything like that... these patterns are about how and when you should create classes, how to deal with state in classes and methods, how to implement behaviour, dealing with exceptional flow and exceptions, different ways of defining and implementing methods, choosing between collection types, and there's even a chapter that deals with some of the complications of developing frameworks and allowing the framework to evolve while minimizing or avoiding breaking code for clients of the framework.

This book is just filled with a lot of great insight on how to write code that clearly expresses the intent of what it's supposed to do. And while it is a very short book (only 130 pages), it's one of those books that'll teach you something new every time you read it. <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/recommended-books/">Must read!</a>
