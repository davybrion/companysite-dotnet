I've blogged about the Request/Response Service Layer (which i'll just abbreviate to RRSL from now on) several times already, but i wanted to group everything there is to know about the RRSL together in a series of posts that should cover everything comprehensively, yet very in-depth.

I wrote a <a href="/blog/2009/07/why-i-dislike-classic-or-typical-wcf-usage/">post</a> a couple of months ago to discuss what i dislike about typical/classic WCF services and how the RRSL solves many of those issues.  If you haven't read that post yet, be sure that you do because i'd rather not repeat the thoughts from that post (yet again ;)) and it'll definitely help you understand some of the choices and decisions that influenced the RRSL.

These are the posts that this series consists of:
