For those of you liked the <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/08/using-more-rubyesq-events-in-ruby/">EventPublisher</a> module that i've been talking about recently, it's now available as a gem.  The code is hosted on <a href="http://github.com/davybrion/EventPublisher">github</a> under the MIT license and you can download/install it with the following command:

gem install eventpublisher

After that, you just need to add the following to your ruby files in order to use it:

require 'eventpublisher'
