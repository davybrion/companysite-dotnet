<p>As i mentioned in my <a href="http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/06/my-first-request-for-the-next-net-version/" target="_blank">last post</a>, i ran into a serialization problem with a Tuple reference when returning it from a WCF call.&#160; It failed with the typical exception you get when a type can not be deserialized. Unfortunately, the message of the exception that i got is the same as it is when a type can not be serialized, though both situations are actually quite different.&#160; One of my readers left a comment saying that he didn’t have problems serializing/deserializing a Tuple (by the way: am i the only one who has major problems with typing the word ‘tuple’? whenever i wanna use it, i always end up with ‘type’ before i realize my mistake) through WCF.&#160; </p>  <p>So why did it work for him, yet failed in my situation? The answer turns out to be quite simple.&#160; If you look at the Tuple type of .NET 4 in Reflector, you’ll see this:</p>  <p><a href="http://davybrion.com/pictures/Mor.TupleAndSerializationDeserialization_124CB/tuple_dotnet.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="tuple_dotnet" border="0" alt="tuple_dotnet" src="http://davybrion.com/pictures/Mor.TupleAndSerializationDeserialization_124CB/tuple_dotnet_thumb.png" width="493" height="40" /></a> </p>  <p>So it actually is serializable.&#160; The thing is, my client is not a .NET project, it’s Silverlight.&#160; And the Tuple type in Silverlight looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://davybrion.com/pictures/Mor.TupleAndSerializationDeserialization_124CB/tuple_silverlight.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="tuple_silverlight" border="0" alt="tuple_silverlight" src="http://davybrion.com/pictures/Mor.TupleAndSerializationDeserialization_124CB/tuple_silverlight_thumb.png" width="497" height="33" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p>Silverlight still doesn’t support the Serializable attribute and the Tuple types don’t have a parameterless constructor, so that’s why it can’t deserialize a Tuple instance when it’s returned from a WCF call.&#160; I can’t believe i didn’t think of this earlier since i’ve been bitten by this problem a few more times (not with the Tuple type, but with other Serializable classes) in the past, but then again, i can’t believe something like this still doesn’t work when using .NET <strong>4</strong>, Silverlight <strong>4</strong> and WCF<strong> 4 </strong>together. </p>
