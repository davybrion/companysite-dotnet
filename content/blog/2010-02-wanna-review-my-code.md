I just wrote some code, and I'd like your opinion on it. The thing is, I'm not going to provide any context as to what it does or why certain decisions were made since I know you guys like to be challenged. You also might want to keep the following in mind when reading it:

- it might contain bugs that I'm not aware of 
- it contains weird parts that were either brainfarts on my part, things I did on purpose to avoid possible issues, or both 
- it contains at least one bug that I know about, yet don’t care about 
- I removed the comments that I originally put in it to make things more interesting 
- I haven’t tested the code yet 
- I haven’t even executed it yet 
- I <em>think</em> it’s ok… but I'm not sure 

Questions will be answered if you have them (and I'm sure you will) though I can’t make any promises as to how soon I can answer them… I will post a follow-up post to discuss the code in its entirety later on, though I'll probably wait a few days to do so.

This is the code:
