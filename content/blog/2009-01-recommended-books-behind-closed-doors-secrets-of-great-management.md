I don't really have any interest in management, but i read a great recommendation for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Closed-Doors-Management-Programmers/dp/0976694026/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231699931&sr=8-1">this book</a> recently (forgot the link) so i couldn't resist ordering it.  It consists of two parts.  The first 120 pages is a bit of a story about a manager who was just hired to lead one of the departments of a software development company.  In between the story (which is an easy and interesting read), you'll find lots of great insight into what great management is all about.  The last 40 pages are great descriptions of 13 management techniques.

This book is a must-read for anyone doing any kind of management (even if it's just project management), and i'd even <a href="/blog/recommended-books">recommend</a> it to non-managers as well.  It is just filled with great insight, tips and things that everyone should know about, not just managers. 

And for those of you who're too lazy to read a book (and i know there's at least a few of you ;)), it's only 160 pages so it's not like this will eat up a lot of your time.
