There are no chapters, there is no unifying theme, there is no structure whatsoever.  There is just a lot of great content.  Around 50 software architects contributed 97 pieces to the book, each one filling up about 2 (small) pages.  In a way, reading these pieces feels like reading great blog posts, though without the usual blogodrama.  It's great stuff for when you want to spend an hour reading, or for when you have a couple of minutes to spare.  There's even a <a href="http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki">website</a> which contains all of the original, unedited contributions so the cheapskates among you can read it all as well :)
