I think this might be an interesting challenge for all of you. The code that will be listed below contains a non-obvious solution.  The reason why I went with the non-obvious solution, or what exactly the non-obvious part is, will not be mentioned in this post.  What I want to know is: do you guys truly understand this code without any sort of "why I did this" comment in the code?  I think the code is very readable, and pretty communicative.  So according to many coding purists, it should not contain any comments.  I am particularly interested in finding out if these coding purists think that this code should contain a "why I did it like this" comment or not.

Now, it certainly is possible that there is a more communicative way to write the same code.  If so, I would be very interested to hear about any possible improvements you can come up with :)

I will do a follow-up post about this soon.  Perhaps tomorrow, or in a few days, depending on how clear or unclear this code turns out to be.

So, this is the code:
