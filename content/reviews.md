# Technical reviews
Over the years I have frequently been asked to do code reviews to highlight problems and offer solutions. And I've noticed that a lot of projects can benefit tremendously from an independent, unbiased code review. Of course, there are many aspects that need to be taken into consideration when reviewing code. A code review can focus on one or more of those aspects, but my experience has taught me that a code review is typically more effective when it focuses on a limited set of aspects. Code review aspects that I have most experience with are the following:

- Quality of data access code and approaches
- Code maintainability/readability
- System stability/reliability
- Performance
- Scalability
- Service design
- Overall design/architectural concerns
- Testability

If you're interested in having me do a code review of one of your projects, [contact me](#contact_section).

## On-site or off-site
Some customers prefer to have code reviews done on-site, so the code doesn't have to leave their network. That of course implies that I have to be on-site during working hours. Another option is to do code reviews off-site. With this model, you can provide me the code and I'll deliver the code review document at an agreed upon point in time. This offers me the freedom to work on this after normal working hours, so I can offer a lower rate on this. If you don't feel comfortable with your source code leaving company premises, I'm more than willing to sign legal documents if necessary. And of course, there's always the option of an on-site review if that's what you prefer.
