# What extra mile?

My name is Davy Brion. I'm an independent software developer/architect living and working in Belgium. I started That Extra Mile in January 2011 to offer a few services in the field of software development. I have long held the belief that too many people are too easily satisfied with the quality of technical solutions, particularly in the case of custom developed software. A lot of people in this industry take too many shortcuts, which often results in more maintenance or rework afterwards and substandard results. I made this mistake in the beginning of my career as well, but I was lucky enough to feel the pain from those shortcuts. It taught me that it's worth going that extra mile to get to a higher level of quality. On non-trivial software development projects, it invariably leads to less expended effort in the long run.

This has lead me on a path of continuously learning new things and improving my skills. I've been documenting this path on my [blog](http://davybrion.com), which has seen year-over-year growth in readership for the past 4 years. I've been part of the [NHibernate](http://nhforge.org/) development team for about a year, and have released another Open Source project called [Agatha](http://davybrion.github.com/Agatha/). You can check out more of my code on [Github](https://github.com/davybrion).
