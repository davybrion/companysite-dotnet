# Short-term consulting

While I mostly do contracting, I'm also available for short-term on-site consulting throughout the year. With short-term I mean 1 to 3 days for very specific assignments, or a periodic 1 day visit. These assignments will primarily focus on one (or more) of these areas:

- Performance
- Scalability
- System stability/reliability
- Data Access (general)
- NHibernate
- Service design
- Design/Architecture (general)
- Code maintainability/readability
- Automated testing
- Continuous Integration
- Automated builds & deploys

The bulk of my professional experience is with the .NET platform, though I'm continuously expanding my skill set with Node.js (here's a [high level overview](http://davybrion.com/blog/2011/12/node-js-for-dummies/) on my blog), client-side JavaScript and Ruby as well. If you think I can help you or your developers, [contact me](#contact_section) for more details.
