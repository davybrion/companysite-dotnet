# Blog Archive

This is the archive of my blog, which used to be hosted on my personal site. It originally had about 650 posts but I removed almost half of them, either because they were outdated, no longer relevant or because I just didn't see any more value in the content anymore. Feel free to browse through the archive, or you might want to check out the following pages specifically:

- New Here? : an overview of my better posts
- Categories : a list of all of the categories of posts
- Recommended books : a list of books that I recommend to software developers
